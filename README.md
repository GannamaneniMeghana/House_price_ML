🚀 Just Completed a Machine Learning Project: House Price Prediction App
I’m excited to share my latest ML project where I built a House Price Prediction Web App using:
🔍 Tech Stack
* Python (Scikit-Learn, NumPy, Pandas)
* Linear Regression Model
* Flask Backend
* HTML + CSS Frontend
* Pickle for model deployment
🧠 What the Model Does
The model predicts house prices based on:
🏠 House Age (years)

🛏️ Number of Bedrooms

📏 Area (sqft)

After training and evaluating the model, I integrated it with a clean and modern UI. Users can enter the values and instantly get the predicted price.

📊 Model Performance

Using a Linear Regression model, I evaluated:

MSE

RMSE

R² Score

This helped in validating how well the model fits real data.

💡 What I Learned

End-to-end ML workflow (Data → Model → Evaluation → Deployment)

Creating API endpoints with Flask

Connecting ML models with frontend interfaces

Improving UI/UX for ML apps

🎯 Future Enhancements

Try other ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost)

Add more features to improve accuracy

Deploy on cloud (Render / AWS / Azure)

Below are some screenshots of the UI and backend setup 👇
